14.1 Arable Land,"Includes cereal fields, rice paddies, perennial crops, orchards and groves (but see 14.3 and 14.4).","Secondary grasslands may be coded here or under 14.2, depends on the usage.",1401,TRUE,(LC == 40),All copernicus land categories with arable land are considered arable land. Small fields can be considered rural gardens (see 14.4) and are excluded previously. 
14.2 Pastureland,"Includes fertilized or re-seeded permanent grasslands, sometimes treated with selective herbicides, with very impoverished flora and fauna. Also includes secondary grasslands and wooded farmland.",,1402,TRUE,(LC == 30 || LC == 20 || LC == 100 || LC == 60) && pasture == 1),"Broad grassland, shrubland and herbaceous vegetation cover that is also predominantly used as pasture site. Custom Global pasture mask"
14.3 Plantations,"A plantation is an intentional planting of a crop, on a larger scale, usually for uses other than cereal production or pasture. The term is currently most often used for plantings of trees and shrubs. The term tends also to be used for plantings maintained on economic bases other than that of subsistence farming. Plantations are typically (but not exclusively) found in tropical or semitropical countries and usually require resident labourers.",,1403,TRUE,(plantation == 1 && ((LC >= 111 && LC <= 116) || ((LC >= 111 && LC <= 126) && subtropics == 1  )) ),TBD!  Plantations being defined as all tree covered land that is 'forest' according to the Copernicus land cover map as well as 'planted forest' according to the IIASA developed Forest management layer
14.4 Rural Gardens,"Rural gardens are located in a rural setting, serving families whose main income comes from wage labour (rural or urban). Rural gardens differ from arable land production by the following features which are usually, but by no means in all cases, found simultaneously: (1) cropping plants for personal consumption that cannot be collected nor supplied by arable farming, (2) small plots, (3) proximity to the house, (4) fencing, (5) mixed or dense planting of a great number of annual, semi-permanent, and perennial crops, (6) a high intensity of land use, (7) land cultivation several times a year, (8) permanence of cultivation, and (9) cultivation with hand implements. These gardens also provide space and/or fodder for the raising of small animals (usually poultry, rodents and small ruminants). In extreme cases, the rural garden may be the only source of livelihood and income for the rural poor. If enough space is available, small cash crops may be produced and exchanged or sold for purchased food.",Market gardens should be coded here.,1404,TRUE,((subtropics == 1 && iiasa_smallfields == 1) && (LC == 40 && urbanboundary == 1) ),"Very challenging to map, given that this habitat is a mixture of biophysical and socioeconomic parameters (there is no way to quantify wage labour spatially). Here defined as croplands sites in the sub-urban boundary area (500m near urban land cover) where the IIASA field size indicates a field of small size. Furthermore limited to the tropics and sub-tropics (23.5° above and below the equator)"
14.5 Urban Areas,"Occurs throughout the world. Usually metropolitan and commercial areas dominated by asphalt, concrete and roof. Includes buildings, lawns and parks",,1405,TRUE,(LC == 50),Urban areas are urban covered land according to Copernicus or bare land that is not already a desert or trees/parks in urban areas according to the IIASA developed Forest management layer.
14.6 Subtropical/Tropical Heavily Degraded Former Forest,Former subtropical or tropical forest that has been extensively cleared or impacted by human activities. Often there is some degree of regeneration or there are small fragments of forest remaining.,There is currently no differentiation between lowland and montane types.,1406,FALSE,,"Not mapped. Potentially added in the future.  Implies that conversion to plantation or reforestation is excluded, but natural regeneration can happen. It basically represents largely clear-felled forest with some degree of regeneration."
